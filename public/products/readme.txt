# Product Images Directory

This directory should contain all the product images for the door and window website.

## Required Images

Based on the product data in `app/data/products.ts`, you need to place the following images in this directory:

### Door Images
- door-classic.jpg - A traditional entry door with panels
- door-modern.jpg - A contemporary door with glass panels
- door-french.jpg - French patio door with multiple glass panels
- door-barn.jpg - A rustic sliding barn door

### Window Images
- window-double-hung.jpg - A classic double-hung window
- window-casement.jpg - A casement window that opens outward
- window-bay.jpg - An elegant bay window unit
- window-sliding.jpg - A horizontal sliding window

## Image Guidelines

For best results:
- Use high-quality professional images
- Maintain consistent aspect ratios (recommended: 3:2 or 4:3)
- Optimal resolution: 1200 x 800 pixels or higher
- Use well-lit photos that clearly show the product details
- Remove backgrounds or use consistent neutral backgrounds
- Save in JPG format with good quality (80% or higher)

## Image Placement

The images should be placed directly in this directory, not in subdirectories, as the product data references them with paths like '/products/door-classic.jpg'.
